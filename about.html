                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p> With a degree in Computer Engineering and a UI/UX design internship experience, I was offered a junior position as the product owner of an employee-engagement app. 
                        I managed to work first-hand in creating new features and experiences for the app.
                    </p>
                    <p> I became the subject matter expert of the app by proposing new ideas, 
                        QA testing and supporting enquiries from different stakeholders. 
                        I mostly worked along the UI/UX team and development team.                       
                    </p>

                    <p> I know it's a rare experience, I think I did alright with the positive feedback from my colleagues.
                    </p>
